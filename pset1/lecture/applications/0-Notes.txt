**general notes**

- What is a compile: Is a software program that take your source code and convert it to machine code (0s and 1s).

- How to do it?: the commande line is "clang". "Ex: clang hello.c"

- When you compile a source code, a machine code (.out) will be created. It has all the 0s and 1s.

- What is a library: is just a collection of someone's code. such that: <cs50.h>

- float generally use 32bits which gives you that many 0's and 1's with which to represent a floating point value or a real number.

- If you use double instead of float, you get 64 bits.

- 'Y': single quotes are used when we work with 1 single character.

- "The": double quotes are used when we work with multiple characters.




**linux command line notes**

clang: Used to compile the source code.

clang -o hello hello.c : "Hey computer take the hello.c as your input and output a file name called 'hello' "
-o: is an argument

ls" : "Hey computer, list all the files in the current folder".

mkdir: is a command line used to create a folder in the current folder.

cd: used to enter inside a directory (folder).

cd ..: means "go back one directory" ~ "go to your parent".

**parameters**

%s: is a place holder and it type is "string".



**functions**

get_string: "Hey computer, go and get me a string".
get_char: "if we want to get a character".
get_int: "for integer".
get_float: "for decimal number"
get_double:
get_long_long:


**Important Notes**

- You have to recompile your source code each time you make a changement on your source code.

- if the type of the variable is like (int), we must only use %i as place holder of parameters.

- if you use switch function, dont forget to use "break" with it.
